AstraXagent is a lightweight, modular multi-agent framework designed to automate and coordinate tasks using AI-driven agents. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as file management, resume processing, job portal tracking, and task automation. The framework supports easy integration with cloud services like AWS, GCP, and Azure, and can be extended to a variety of use cases that require task delegation and orchestration between multiple agents.

Key Features:
Multi-Agent System: Coordinate multiple independent agents to perform specific tasks.

Modular Architecture: Each agent can be customized to handle different operations (e.g., file management, resume scoring, job portal scraping).

AI Integration: Use Generative AI models (like GPT-4) for decision-making and task automation.

Cloud-Ready: Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability and distributed task management.

Agent Memory: Store agent activity data in structured formats (JSON) for easy retrieval and tracking.

#AstraXDeploy
AstraXDeploy is a deployment framework designed to automate the process of deploying your multi-agent systems, AI models, and automation workflows across cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

## **AstraXTrack: Monitoring and Tracking Framework for Multi-Agent Systems**

**AstraXTrack** is designed to monitor and track multi-agent workflows, AI model performance, and cloud resource utilization in real-time. It provides tools for observing, logging, and optimizing AI agent activities, ensuring smooth operation and real-time performance monitoring.

### üîç **What Does AstraXTrack Do?**

**AstraXTrack** enhances your ability to:

* **Trace Multi-Agent Interactions**: Log every agent's input, output, and actions during its execution. This helps visualize and debug agent behavior, identifying any unexpected outcomes in the workflow.
* **Evaluate Performance**: Automatically assess agent performance and task completion based on predefined criteria, such as execution time, response accuracy, or task success.
* **Prompt Engineering & Customization**: Adjust agent behaviors through custom tasks and workflows and visualize their impact on performance.
* **Monitoring and Dashboarding**: Provide live dashboards to monitor KPIs like resource usage, task latency, success rates, and failures.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How to Use AstraXTrack**

1. **Sign Up and Integrate**:

   * Create an account for **AstraXTrack** (or set up an internal server for private usage).
   * Set up environment variables or API keys to allow agents to send trace data.

2. **Integrate Trace Logging**:

   * Add tracing hooks in your agent functions to send input-output logs to **AstraXTrack** for real-time visualization.

   Example:

   ```python
   import astraxtrack

   def my_agent_function(input_data):
       output_data = process(input_data)
       astraxtrack.log_trace(agent="AgentName", input=input_data, output=output_data)
       return output_data
   ```

3. **Dashboard Monitoring**:

   * Set up a dashboard to track execution metrics, agent performance, and system health.
   * Track metrics like time taken per task, completion status, token usage, etc.

4. **Evaluate Outputs and Agent Behavior**:

   * Use **AstraXTrack** to automatically evaluate task completions or performance with criteria that suit your system‚Äôs needs.

5. **Collaborate and Adjust Tasks**:

   * Use a collaborative UI to adjust agent tasks, workflows, or prompts based on real-time data.

---

### üß™ **Use Cases for AstraXTrack**

* **Debugging and Troubleshooting**:

  * Track agent actions and interactions to debug issues in multi-agent workflows.
  * Check for errors or unexpected behaviors based on real-time logs.

* **Performance Optimization**:

  * Monitor latency, resource consumption, and task completion time to optimize your multi-agent system.

* **Quality Assurance**:

  * Evaluate agent outputs against predefined criteria and check for consistent performance across different agents and tasks.

* **Collaborative Iteration**:

  * Work with your team to improve agent tasks and workflows in real time based on the insights gathered from the dashboard and traces.

---

### **Key Features of AstraXTrack**

* **Agent Trace Logging**: Log inputs, outputs, and intermediate states for every agent to understand and debug the agent‚Äôs execution flow.
* **Real-Time Dashboards**: Visualize key metrics, agent performance, task success rates, and system health in live dashboards.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate agent outputs based on defined KPIs such as task accuracy, performance, and resource efficiency.
* **Collaboration Tools**: Allow team members to collaboratively modify agent tasks, workflows, and parameters for continuous improvement.

### **Installation and Setup for AstraXTrack**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AstraXTrack/astraxtrack.git
   cd astraxtrack
   ```

2. **Setup Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   export ASTRAXTRACK_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export ASTRAXTRACK_LOGGING="true"
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Integrate with Agents**:

   * Modify your agent functions to send traces to **AstraXTrack** for monitoring.

5. **Monitor via Dashboard**:

   * Use the **AstraXTrack** dashboard for live metrics and debugging.



This would send traces of `input_data` and `output_data` to **AstraXTrack**, allowing you to track performance, evaluate success, and optimize accordingly.
